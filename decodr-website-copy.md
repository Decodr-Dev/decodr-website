# Decodr Website Copy

All the text for every page on the site. Ready to hand to a developer or drop into a builder. Placeholder notes are marked with [BRACKETS].

The tone throughout: like a smart friend explaining something they built. Warm, clear, a little playful. Never corporate. Never stiff.

### Hero Section

**Badge/tag above headline:**
Free to start. No card needed.

**Headline:**
NotebookLM is great. Staying organized in it? Not so much.

**Subheadline:**
Decodr adds the stuff NotebookLM forgot: folders, tags, imports, and a prompt library. Everything lives right inside the page, so it feels like it was always there.

**Primary CTA button:** Add to Chrome — it's free
**Secondary CTA / link:** See what's included

### "The Problem" Section (optional, but effective)

**Small label above:** Sound familiar?

**Headline:** NotebookLM is powerful. But the more you use it...

**Body (short paragraphs, not bullets):**

Your notebook list turns into a wall of "Untitled Notebook (4)." You can't group anything. You can't tag anything. You want to import a YouTube playlist and the answer is "do it one video at a time." Your PDF is 10MB over the limit and now you need to go find some random compression site.

It's not that NotebookLM is bad. It's that the organization and import tools just aren't there yet.

That's where Decodr comes in.

---

### Features Section

**Headline:** What Decodr actually does

**Subheadline:** Everything runs right inside the NotebookLM page. No popups, no separate dashboard. It just works where you already are.

---

**Feature 1: Folders**

**Title:** Folders that make sense

**Description:**
Group your notebooks by project, class, topic, whatever system works for you. Inside each notebook, your sources and generated content can be organized into folders too. No more scrolling through a flat list hoping you recognize the name.

[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of folder system in NotebookLM]

---

**Feature 2: Tags**

**Title:** Color-coded tags for quick filtering

**Description:**
Tag notebooks and sources with custom labels. Color-code them however you want. Then filter to find exactly what you need in seconds instead of minutes.

[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of tags and filtering]

---

**Feature 3: One-Click Imports**

**Title:** Import from everywhere, all at once

**Description:**
Pull in conversations from ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini with one click. Import YouTube videos, full playlists, or entire channels. Clip articles and selected text from any webpage. Stop copying and pasting. Just click.

[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of import options]

---

**Feature 4: Smart Import**

**Title:** The stuff NotebookLM can't handle on its own

**Description:**
Import Anki flashcards and other file types NotebookLM doesn't natively support. Got a PDF that's too big? Decodr compresses it automatically or splits it into smaller parts. No more bouncing between random tools just to upload a file.

[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of PDF compression or Anki import]

---

**Feature 5: Prompt Library**

**Title:** Save your best prompts. Reuse them forever.

**Description:**
If you keep typing the same prompts over and over ("summarize the key arguments," "create practice questions," "explain this like I'm five"), just save them. One click to insert. Works across all your notebooks.

[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of prompt library]

---

**Feature 6: Progress Tracking**

**Title:** See where you stand

**Description:**
Track your progress across notebooks and folders. Know what you've covered, what still needs attention, and where to pick up next. Helpful when you're managing multiple projects or studying for more than one thing.

[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of progress tracker]

---

### How It Works Section

**Headline:** Up and running in about 30 seconds

**Step 1:**
Install Decodr from the Chrome Web Store. It's free.

**Step 2:**
Open NotebookLM. Decodr's features are already there, embedded right into the page.

**Step 3:**
Start organizing, importing, and saving prompts. That's it. There's no setup wizard or onboarding flow to sit through.

**CTA:** Add to Chrome

---

### Social Proof / Trust Section

[PLACEHOLDER: Skip this section for now. Add it once you have reviews and user numbers. When ready, keep it simple:]

[Future format:]
- A few short quotes from real users
- Number of users
- Chrome Web Store rating
- "Trusted by students, researchers, and people with too many notebooks"

---

### "Built for..." Section

**Headline:** Built for anyone who uses NotebookLM more than casually

**Body:**

**Students** juggling notebooks for every class, importing lecture videos and flashcards, trying to keep everything from turning into chaos.

**Researchers** managing literature reviews across dozens of papers, tagging by status, tracking what's been read and what hasn't.

**Content creators** pulling in YouTube videos, articles, and AI conversations as source material for their next project.

**Anyone** who opened NotebookLM one day, looked at their notebook list, and thought "this is getting out of hand."

---

### Privacy Section (brief)

**Headline:** Your stuff stays your stuff

**Body:**
Decodr runs locally in your browser. We don't read your notebooks, we don't store your content, and we don't send anything to external servers. Sign-in uses Google OAuth and that's the only data we touch. We built this to help you organize, not to collect your data.

**Headline:** Ready to get your notebooks under control?

**Subheadline:** Free to start. Takes about 30 seconds to install. And your future self will thank you.

## PAGE 3: FAQ

---

### Headline
Got questions? Good.

### Subheadline
If yours isn't here, email us at support@decodr.app and we'll sort it out.

---

**Q: What is Decodr?**
A: Decodr is a Chrome extension that adds folders, tags, imports, a prompt library, and progress tracking to NotebookLM. Think of it as a power toolkit that fills in the gaps NotebookLM hasn't gotten around to yet. Everything lives right inside the NotebookLM page, so it doesn't feel like a separate tool.

---

**Q: Is Decodr free?**
A: There's a free tier that gives you a solid set of features with some limits (2 folders, 3 tags, 5 prompts, etc.). If you need more, Decodr Plus removes all limits. It starts at $2.99/mo and there's a lifetime option for $49 if you'd rather pay once and be done with it. Every paid plan comes with a 7-day free trial, no credit card required.

---

**Q: How does the free trial work?**
A: You get full access to all Plus features for 7 days. No credit card upfront. Use it like you normally would, try everything, and see if it makes a difference in your workflow. If it does, pick a plan. If not, no hard feelings. You'll just go back to the free tier.

---

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Yep. No cancellation fees, no hoops to jump through, no passive aggressive emails. Go to your account settings, click cancel, done. You'll keep Plus until your current billing period ends.

---

**Q: What happens to my stuff if I cancel or downgrade?**
A: Nothing gets deleted. Your notebooks, sources, and everything inside them stays safe. But any folders, tags, or prompts you created beyond the free limits will be hidden until you resubscribe. Your extra stuff just takes a little nap. It's all still there if you come back.

---

**Q: Is the lifetime deal actually lifetime?**
A: Yes. One payment, permanent access to Plus. No renewals, no surprise charges, no fine print that says "lifetime means 3 years." It's the real deal.

---

**Q: Does Decodr access or store my notebook content?**
A: Nope. Decodr runs entirely in your browser. We don't read your notebooks, we don't store your content, and we don't send it anywhere. The only data we handle is your Google sign-in for authentication. That's it.

---

**Q: What browsers does it work on?**
A: Decodr is a Chrome extension, so it works on Chrome and any Chromium-based browser like Edge, Brave, Arc, and Opera.

---

**Q: Will Decodr break if NotebookLM updates?**
A: Possible, but unlikely. We keep an eye on NotebookLM changes and update Decodr to stay compatible. If something breaks after a NotebookLM update, we'll fix it as fast as we can. You can reach us at support@decodr.app if you run into anything weird.

---

**Q: Can I import from ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini?**
A: Yes. Open any conversation in ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, and Decodr lets you import it directly into a NotebookLM notebook with one click. No copy-pasting, no formatting headaches.

---

**Q: Can I import YouTube playlists or entire channels?**
A: On the free tier you can import individual YouTube videos (up to 3/week). With Plus, you get unlimited imports plus the ability to pull in full playlists and entire channels in one go.

---

**Q: Can I import Anki flashcards?**
A: Yes. Decodr handles Anki decks and other file types that NotebookLM doesn't support natively. Just select your file and it takes care of the conversion.

---

**Q: My PDF is too large for NotebookLM. Can Decodr help?**
A: That's literally one of the reasons we built this. Decodr can compress your PDF to fit under NotebookLM's 200MB limit, or split it into smaller parts if compression alone isn't enough. Both options are available on all plans, including Free.

---

**Q: What payment methods do you accept?**
A: Credit cards and bank transfers, processed securely through Paystack.

---

**Q: I have a feature request.**
A: We love those. Submit it here: [feature request link]. We read every single one and it genuinely shapes what we build next.

---

**Q: Something isn't working. Where do I get help?**
A: Email us at support@decodr.app. We're a small team and we reply fast.

## PAGE 4: ABOUT

---

### Headline
We just wanted folders.

---

### Body

Decodr started the way a lot of tools start. We were using NotebookLM every day, we loved it, and then one afternoon we stared at a list of 40+ unsorted notebooks and thought "there has to be a better way to organize this."

There wasn't. So we built one.

What began as "just add folders" quickly turned into "well, while we're here..." Folders became tags. Tags became imports. Imports became a prompt library. And before we knew it, we had a full toolkit.

We're a small team and we use Decodr ourselves for our own research, learning, and work. Every feature we build starts with a problem we actually have. If we wouldn't use it, we don't ship it.

We released early because we believe in building with people, not just for them. The extension is evolving fast and a lot of what's on the roadmap comes directly from user feedback and feature requests.

If you have ideas, complaints, or just want to tell us about your favorite notebook, we're at support@decodr.app. We read everything.

### Small callout or sidebar

## PAGE 7: PRIVACY POLICY

### Headline
Privacy Policy

### Last updated: [Date]

---

### The short version

Decodr runs in your browser. We don't read your notebooks, store your content, or send your data to third parties. The only information we collect is what's needed to make the extension work and process payments.

---

### The longer version

**What we collect**

When you sign in with Google OAuth, we receive your name, email address, and profile picture. This is used for authentication and account management. That's it.

If you purchase Decodr Plus, your payment is processed by Paystack. We do not store your credit card details. Paystack handles all payment data according to their own privacy policy and security standards.

**What we don't collect**

We do not collect, store, read, or transmit:
- The contents of your NotebookLM notebooks
- Your sources, notes, or generated content
- Your browsing history
- Any data from the websites you visit

Decodr operates entirely within your browser. Your notebook data stays between you and NotebookLM (Google).

**How the extension works**

Decodr injects features into the NotebookLM interface. All organization features (folders, tags, prompt library, progress tracking) are stored locally in your browser. Import features work by passing content directly to NotebookLM through the browser. At no point does your content pass through our servers.

**Analytics**

We may collect basic, anonymized usage data such as which features are used most frequently. This helps us understand what to improve. This data is aggregated and never linked to individual users or their content.

[PLACEHOLDER: If you use any specific analytics tools, name them here.]

**Cookies**

Decodr itself does not use cookies. If you visit our website, standard web cookies may be used for basic site functionality.

**Third-party services**

- Google OAuth (authentication)
- Paystack (payment processing)

Each of these services has their own privacy policies which govern how they handle your data.

**Data deletion**

If you want your account data removed, email support@decodr.app and we'll take care of it.

**Changes to this policy**

If we make significant changes to this policy, we'll let you know through the extension or by email. Minor updates may be made without notice.

**Contact**
